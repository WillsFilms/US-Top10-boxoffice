# Box Office Analysis

This project takes data from Box Office Mojo on the top 10 highest grossing films at the US box office in the 21st century and examines and analyses various aspects of it. It also looks at the overall US box office numbers; i.e., total gross.

I will look to automate the process of scraping data from Box Office Mojo in the future to expediate the process. I have set up a jupyter notebook that will process the input data into a number of pre-defined charts as listed below:

## 1. Box office budgets for highest grossing film

I will look to improve what insights I can gain from this data. This will include introducing an inflation adjustment for budget/gross data to provide a more reliable measure.
